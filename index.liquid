<h2>Blog Demo</h2>

<p>
This is my blog. It will be informative. It will amuse you. It will blah blah etc and so forth. I'm just filling up
some space here and I'd rather not use lorem ipsum. So how are you? How are you doing? In general, this is a stressful
time for us all, but luckily we have cats. Cats make everything better.

<ul>
{% for post in collections.posts reversed %}
  <li><a href="{{post.url}}">{{ post.data.title }}</a> ({{ post.date | dtFormat }})</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
